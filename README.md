# flask-api
An example flask rest API server.

To build production, type `make prod`.

To create the env for a new developer, run `make dev_env`.


# mongodb for mac, brew installation
`brew update`

`brew tap mongodb/brew`

`brew install mongodb-community@8.0`

start: `brew services start mongodb/brew/mongodb-community@8.0`

stop:  `brew services stop mongodb/brew/mongodb-community@8.0`

To use mongoDB, you connect to the client via connect_db() from data/db_connect: client= connect_db()
Then, replace the existing functions in people.py...roles.py....text.py...etc...to CRUD data from corresponding collection in the client (of selected parameter.)

# mongodb for mac, remote access
TEMP PASSWORD FOR TESTING: `mongoPASSWORD`

We will be using Atlas for our service. Provided over AWS. 
1. Execute the command first
`python -m pip install "pymongo[srv]"==3.12`. This driver will be used for Atlas. 
2. Following will be an example of how to connection
mongodb+srv://kc0000:PASSWORD@cluster0.q7jza.mongodb.net/?retryWrites=true&w=majority&appName=Cluster0   
I will not be sharing the username/password here. 
Replace kc0000 and PASSWORD accordingly. 
3. You may need to set these variables. One way is to add this to the bash file of the enviroment.   
`export CLOUD_MONGO="CLOUD"`   
`export MONGO_PW="PASSWORD"`  # Replace with your actual password
4. You will probably need to update your CA certificate to verify the ssl connection. You can also manually set `ssl=False` in the connection URL, which I do not recommend.  
`pip install --upgrade certifi`  
`/Applications/Python\ 3.12/Install\ Certificates.command`

`./local.sh`
You should be good to go
